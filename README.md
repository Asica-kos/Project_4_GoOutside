# **Project 4 - GoOutside**

Welcome to the **GoOutside Data Warehouse** project! This repository contains everything you need to set up a scalable, secure, and organized data solution for GoOutside, leveraging Googleâ€™s powerful data tools: BigQuery, Sheets, and Looker Studio. 

## Who is GoOutside and what's the project about?

GoOutside is a rapidly growing startup with a loyal customer base and expanding inventory. As the business grows, managing sales data and customer insights becomes increasingly complex. 

This project is focused on addressing the current data challenges by:

1. Setting up a centralized data warehouse in Google BigQuery to manage and store all sales, customer, and product information efficiently.
2. Developing Google Sheets that are simple and accessible, allowing team members without technical expertise to easily access and use important data.
3. Creating dynamic, interactive Looker Studio dashboards to provide clear insights into key business metrics, including sales performance, top-selling products, and customer trends.

## What we used?

**Google BigQuery**: A fully-managed, serverless data warehouse that allows for fast SQL queries on large datasets.

**Google Sheets**: A collaborative, cloud-based spreadsheet tool that will serve as the interface for non-technical users.

**Google Looker Studio**: A tool to create dynamic, data-driven dashboards to visualize and report on business performance.

## What we've learnt?

This lesson shows how modern data tools can transform unstructured, inaccessible information into valuable, actionable business insights. 
To create user-friendly interfaces using Google Sheets, allowing non-technical team members to work with data without needing advanced SQL skills.
